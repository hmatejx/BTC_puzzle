## Thoughts

I was too late to get the bounty (damn you bussiness travels), but it was fun!

Anyway, it was huge fun and an excellent learning opportunity. Before this I did not really know how Bitcoin private keys and addresses work. Many thanks to Reddit user [u/koljBmHsf](https://www.reddit.com/user/koljBmHsf)!
